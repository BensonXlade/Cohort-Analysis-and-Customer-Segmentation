Problem & Aim:
The client was facing challenges in retaining customers and understanding the impact of their marketing campaigns. The aim was to identify customer cohorts, track their behavior over time, and develop actionable insights to improve retention rates.

What I Did:
I performed cohort analysis to group customers by their first interaction date and tracked their behavior across different time periods. The analysis allowed me to assess the impact of various factors on customer retention and identify opportunities for targeted interventions.

How I Did It:
I used a step-by-step approach, starting with data cleaning and preprocessing. Next, I defined cohorts based on the user’s initial purchase date. I calculated retention rates for each cohort, segmenting them by key behavioral metrics. Finally, I visualized the results using dashboards to provide clear insights for stakeholders.

Teck Stack:
	•	Python (Pandas, NumPy) for data manipulation and analysis
	•	Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
	•	Jupyter Notebooks for an interactive analysis environment
	•	SQL for querying data from the client’s database
  . Clustering Algorithms

Result:
By identifying key cohorts and trends in user behavior, I provided the client with actionable insights that led to a 15% increase in retention rates in the following quarter. The project helped improve marketing strategies and better target high-value customer segments.
